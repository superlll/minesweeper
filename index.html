<p>Requirement: Command-Line Minesweeper. Write a function which consumes three arguments width height number_of_mines and generates a Minesweeper board internally. The board is a rectangle with a cover over each square. It will display this board to the user and prompt for a coordinate where they predict that no mine exists (format: x-coord y-coord 0-indexed). If they struck a mine then they lose (let them know). Otherwise uncover the selected square. If there are no adjacent mines then it should be blank and you uncover all adjacent squares too (chain-react this for every blank square). Otherwise show the number of mines in the surrounding 8 squares. If at somepoint only mines are covered then the user wins and the game ends.<br></p>

<p>This project is for minesweeper game. Firstly, I create a 9x9 field indicating the game field. Secondly I set all the field with -1 indicating field that had not been clicked. Then I generates random number and set mines where number is 9. Then calaulate number of mine around a coordinate being clicked and print. It calculates the number of mines and when the user click all the coordinate without mine, the user wins. If user click a blank field, it will enlarge the field with 3x3 field in center of blank coordinate. Function start() is to stimulate the game if the coordinate has not been click, then return the function itself, else calculate the numbers of mines around the coordinate. Function print()is to show the layout Function check(), whose type is bool is to check if the user had click all the field without mines. I generate rand number with seed(time(0)) and lay mines in main() function.</p>
